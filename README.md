# ML-Presentation
My presentation in Machine Learning  is related to three topics: CNN, SVM, and RBF which I tried to explain and implement them according to my project with the Keras library in Python, the main part of my research was on CNN, and next to it I also paid SVM and RBF.
I devoted several months to this research, which had several parts and was very voluminous and extensive, and I succeeded in implementing them with the Python language and Keras library.
Finally, I hope that you will benefit from my content
