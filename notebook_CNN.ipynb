    "1. Introduction to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs, like neural networks, are made up of neurons with learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives several inputs, takes a weighted sum over them, pass it through an activation function and responds with an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole network has a loss function and all the basics for neural networks will apply on CNNs as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional neural network (CNN) consists of an input and an output layer, as well as multiple hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layers of a CNN typically consist of a series of convolutional layers that convolve with a multiplication or other dot product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation function is commonly a RELU layer, and is subsequently followed by additional convolutions such as pooling layers, fully connected layers and normalization layers, referred to as hidden layers because their inputs and outputs are masked by the activation function and final convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final convolution, in turn, often involves backpropagation in order to more accurately weight the end product.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs have wide variety of applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. Basic terminology of CNN :\n",
    "\n",
    "We should be aware of some basic terminology regarding CNN. These are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Filters : \n",
    "CNN’s make use of filters to detect what features, such as edges, are present throughout an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "A filter is just a matrix of values, called weights, that are trained to detect specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter moves over each part of the image to check if the feature it is meant to detect is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide a value representing how confident it is that a specific feature is present, the filter carries out a convolution operation, which is an element-wise product and sum between two matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the feature is present in part of an image, the convolution operation between the filter and that part of the image results in a real number with a high value. If the feature is not present, the resulting value is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Convolutional :\n",
    "When programming a CNN, each convolutional layer within a neural network should have the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input is a tensor with shape (number of images) x (image width) x (image height) x (image depth).\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional kernels whose width and height are hyper-parameters, and whose depth must be equal to that of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional layers convolve the input and pass its result to the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 Pooling :\n",
    "Convolutional networks may include local or global pooling layers to streamline the underlying computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling layers reduce the dimensions of the data by combining the outputs of neuron clusters at one layer into a single neuron in the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local pooling combines small clusters, typically 2 x 2. Global pooling acts on all the neurons of the convolutional layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, pooling may compute a max or an average. Max pooling uses the maximum value from each of a cluster of neurons at the prior layer. Average pooling uses the average value from each of a cluster of neurons at the prior layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.4 Fully connected :\n",
    "Fully connected layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in another layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is in principle the same as the traditional multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "The flattened matrix goes through a fully connected layer to classify the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.5 Receptive field :\n",
    "In neural networks, each neuron receives input from some number of locations in the previous layer. In a fully connected layer, each neuron receives input from every element of the previous layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a convolutional layer, neurons receive input from only a restricted subarea of the previous layer. Typically the subarea is of a square shape (e.g., size 5 by 5). The input area of a neuron is called its receptive field.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in a fully connected layer, the receptive field is the entire previous layer. In a convolutional layer, the receptive area is smaller than the entire previous layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.6 Weights :\n",
    "Each neuron in a neural network computes an output value by applying a specific function to the input values coming from the receptive field in the previous layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function that is applied to the input values is determined by a vector of weights and a bias (typically real numbers). Learning, in a neural network, progresses by making iterative adjustments to these biases and weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector of weights and the bias are called filters and represent particular features of the input (e.g., a particular shape).\n",
    "\n",
    "A distinguishing feature of CNNs is that many neurons can share the same filter. This reduces memory footprint because a single bias and a single vector of weights are used across all receptive fields sharing that filter, as opposed to each receptive field having its own bias and vector weighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.7 Strides :\n",
    "Strides is the number of pixels shifts over the input matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the stride is 1 then we move the filters to 1 pixel at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the stride is 2 then we move the filters to 2 pixels at a time and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.8 Padding :\n",
    "In CNNs, we can also apply a technique of filling zeros around the margin of the image to improve the sweep that is done with the sliding window. The parameter to define this technique is called “padding”\n",
    "\n",
    "In CNNs, sometimes filter does not perfectly fit the input image. In this case, we have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply a technique of filling zeros around the margin of the image so that it fits the input image perfectly. This is called zero-padding where we pad the gaps with zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to drop the part of the image where the filter does not fit the image perfectly. This is called valid padding which keeps only valid part of the image."

    "3. What is Convolution :\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks are simple neural networks that use convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name convolutional neural network indicates that the network employs a mathematical operation called convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution is a specialized kind of linear operation. In mathematics, convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions (f and g) that produces a third function expressing how the shape of one is modified by the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term convolution refers to both the result function and to the process of computing it. It is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution is explained visually as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://miro.medium.com/max/390/1*FUEkm0JghT3ab8P7p9c5Qg.png\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above plot, we take the 5x5x3 filter and slide it over the complete image and along the way take the dot product between the filter and chunks of the input image:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://miro.medium.com/max/811/1*3sfzVenrdS5MWGsmSCbx3A.png\n",
    "\n",
    "For every dot product taken, the result is a scalar.\n",
    "Now, we convolve the complete image with the filter as shown below:\n",

    "4. Basic building blocks of CNN :\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple CNN is a sequence of layers, and every layer of a CNN transforms one volume of activations to another through a differentiable function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use three main types of layers to build CNN architectures :\n",
    "-Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, and Fully-Connected Layer. \n",
    "We will stack these layers to form a full CNN architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two other layers - ReLU Layer and Loss Layer that are also used to build a CNN. These layers are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "4.1 Convolutional layer:\n",
    "The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN. The layer's parameters consist of a set of learnable filters (or kernels), which have a small receptive field, but extend through the full depth of the input volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the forward pass, each filter is convolved across the width and height of the input volume, computing the dot product between the entries of the filter and the input and producing a 2-dimensional activation map of that filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the network learns filters that activate when it detects some specific type of feature at some spatial position in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacking the activation maps for all filters along the depth dimension forms the full output volume of the convolution layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every entry in the output volume can thus also be interpreted as an output of a neuron that looks at a small region in the input and shares parameters with neurons in the same activation map.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 Pooling layer:\n",
    "Another important concept of CNNs is pooling, which is a form of non-linear down-sampling. There are several non-linear functions to implement pooling among which max pooling is the most common. It partitions the input image into a set of non-overlapping rectangles and for each such sub-region, outputs the maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the exact location of a feature is less important than its rough location relative to other features. This is the idea behind the use of pooling in convolutional neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pooling layer serves to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation, to reduce the number of parameters, memory footprint and amount of computation in the network, and hence to also control overfitting. It is common to periodically insert a pooling layer between successive convolutional layers in a CNN architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pooling layer operates independently on every depth slice of the input and resizes it spatially. The most common form is a pooling layer with filters of size 2×2 applied with a stride of 2 downsamples at every depth slice in the input by 2 along both width and height, discarding 75% of the activations. In this case, every max operation is over 4 numbers. The depth dimension remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to max pooling, pooling units can use other functions, such as average pooling or ℓ2-norm pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.3 ReLU layer:\n",
    "ReLU is the abbreviation of Rectified Linear Unit, which applies the non-saturating activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is given by the following formula f(x) = max(0,x).\n",
    "\n",
    "It effectively removes negative values from an activation map by setting them to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "It increases the nonlinear properties of the decision function and of the overall network without affecting the receptive fields of the convolution layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "ReLU is often preferred to other functions because it trains the neural network several times faster without a significant penalty to generalization accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.4 Fully connected layer:\n",
    "Finally, after several convolutional and max pooling layers, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is done via fully connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons in a fully connected layer have connections to all activations in the previous layer, as seen in regular (non-convolutional) artificial neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their activations can thus be computed as an affine transformation, with matrix multiplication followed by a bias offset (vector addition of a learned or fixed bias term).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.5 Loss layer:\n",
    "The loss layer specifies how training penalizes the deviation between the predicted (output) and true labels and is normally the final layer of a neural network. Various loss functions are appropriate for different tasks may be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax loss is used for predicting a single class of K mutually exclusive classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid cross-entropy loss is used for predicting K independent probability values in [0,1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean loss is used for regressing to real-valued labels (-∞,∞)."

    "Enough of theory, now its time to see CNN in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how the convolutional neural network can be programmed with Keras using MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several values to be specified in order to parameterize the convolution and pooling stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will use a simplified model with a stride of 1 in each dimension (stride is the size of the step with which the window slides) and a padding of 0 (padding is the filling with zeros around the image). Both these hyperparameters will be presented below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pooling operation will be a max-pooling operation with a 2×2 window.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our CNN model will consist of a convolution followed by a max-pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we will have 32 filters using a 5×5 window for the convolutional layer and a 2×2 window for the pooling layer.\n",
