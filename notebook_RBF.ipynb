Now, you have points (xn,yn) ∈ D, where D is a dataset. All the points in D affect a hypothesis h(x). This means that all the points in the dataset affect and influence a machine learning model. But in our case, it affects h(x) specifically based on ||x – xn|| , i.e the distance"

    "# Relationship to Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Radial Basis Function network is an artificial neural network with an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. It is similar to 2-layer networks, but we replace the activation function with a Gaussian radial basis function. RBF centers can be selected randomly from a set of data by using supervised learning, or they can be defined by using k-means clusters using unsupervised learning[1]. We take each input vector and feed it into each basis. Then, we do a simple weighted sum to get our approximated function value at the end. This is the approximation is compared to the training data and then assigned a value of similarity. We train these using backpropagation like any neural network.\n",

    "\n",
    "RBF short for Radial Basis Function Kernel is a very powerful kernel used in SVM. Unlike linear or polynomial kernels, RBF is more complex and efficient at the same time that it can combine multiple polynomial kernels multiple times of different degrees to project the non-linearly separable data into higher dimensional space so that it can be separable using a hyperplane.\n",
    "The RBF kernel works by mapping the data into a high-dimensional space by finding the dot products and squares of all the features in the dataset and then performing the classification using the basic idea of Linear SVM. For projecting the data into a higher dimensional space, the RBF kernel uses the so-called radial basis function."
